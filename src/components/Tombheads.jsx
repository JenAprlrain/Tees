      <p>The Tombheads Auctionhouse is a multi-chain, Discord-based Auctionhouse that has attracted a 
        collaborative community of top-quality creators from across artistic disciplines, as well as a 
        vibrant community of NFT collectors. The Tombheads team has also pioneered several aspects of 
        the Fantom NFT scene, offering the first and most successful free mint to date, Degenerabbits. 
        This collection included a full roadmap and is among the highest-volume collections on Fantom 
        to date. Tombheads has also partnered with many community artists to host mint events, which 
        have been among the most successful mints on Fantom, and Tombheads Awards, which was a full 
        award-show style event with web 3 flare, as community members nominated and voted for their 
        favorite contributors across several awards categories. OfficialNFTees partnered with Tombheads 
        on a three-piece release within the Royal Tees collection, which are among the highest primary 
        sale pieces to and were sold in the Tombheads Auctionhouse. OfficialNFTees has participated in 
        a number of Tombheads Auctionhouse Regulars auctions throughout 2021 and 2022. </p>
