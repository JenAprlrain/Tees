      <p>Potluck Labs is an NFT incubator that has partnered with tens of popular artists to launch 
        successful NFT collections across seven different blockchains (including, ETH, AVAX, MATIC and 
        HBAR), and continues to expand its reach for its more-than 6,500 unique holders. Unlike NFT 
        launchpads that focus on the launch phase of a collection, as an incubator, Potluck Labs covers 
        everything from the marketing effort, to setting up and launching smart contracts, to assisting 
        with direction and roadmap. Due to this approach and strong team vision, Potluck Labs continues 
        to fill a gap in the NFT space, which has brought value to artists and collectors alike. 
        OfficialNFTees has partnered with Potluck labs for Hedera Holiday sweaters, with additional 
        cross-chain collaborations planned in 2023.</p>
