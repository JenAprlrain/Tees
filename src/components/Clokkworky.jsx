      <p>Clokkworky is an artist who describes his style as, “Psychedelic Cubism - Abstract Art - 
        Psychedelic Art & Pepedelic Cryptocubism.” His unique ability, skill and appeal to crypto 
        space have resulted in some of the highest single-piece sales on Fantom blockchain NFT 
        auctions to date. OfficialNFTees has partnered with Clokkworky on vibrant, three piece 
        collection that brought his artistic genius to the forefront of the Royal Tees collection. 
        Clokkworky has also created a three-piece collection of “Crypto Deities” named by the 
        cross-section of OfficialNFTees/Clokkworky community-members. Limited release of these 
        designs are planned with a TBD drop date. </p>
