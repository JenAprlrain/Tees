      <p>Our Genesis 100 OG NFTee Collection was our first, launching on ZooCoin NFT Marketplace 
        in April of 2021, and subsequently migrating to Paintswap. These NFTees are focused on 
        celebrating the Fantom Ecosystem. Each holder earns royalties earned by the contract from 
        primary and secondary sales, and subsequent collections will also funnel royaltees to holders 
        of these 100 NFTees.</p>
