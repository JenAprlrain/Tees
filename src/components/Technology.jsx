        <h3>Base Web 3 Technology – From the beginning, OfficialNFTees has utilized QR codes to 
            enhance the experience of owning one of our NFTs and physical replicas (the combination of 
            which is often referred to as Phygitals). With the addition of our Web 3 Wardrobe ™, users 
            can prove ownership of their NFTs through a simple QR scan.
            
            Series 1 Technology – through partnership with Authentic Vision, a world leader in 
            authentication labels, and their Meta Anchor ™ technology, OfficialNFTees has added a 
            layer of security to our physicals. Meta Anchors are a serialized, 1/1 holographic QR 
            labels that are not replicable, even by the machines that created them. This technology 
            adds a layer of verification of authenticity the precedes the proof of ownership over the 
            NFTee in the Web3 Wardrobe ™.
