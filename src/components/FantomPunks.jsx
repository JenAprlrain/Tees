      <p>Sarge is one of the pioneers of the Fantom NFT scene, whose 100-piece collection of 
        FantomPunks has been among the most popular on Fantom since launching in early 2021. 
        Since then, Sarge has contributed much to the community through free mints, airdrops to 
        existing FantomPunks Holders, and his “SWOL” art collaborations with NFT Incubator Potluck 
        Labs. FantomPunks, in combination with Gotham Apes, also hosted a first-of-its-kind in-person 
        NFT Auction in Austin, TX during SXSW in March of 2021. TEES and FantomPunks made one of the 
        first multi-NFT collaborations on the Fantom blockchain as part of the FantomPunks and Royal 
        Tees collections</p>
